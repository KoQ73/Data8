All of the data they aggregate are published in the [Systema Globalis](https://github.com/open-numbers/ddf--gapminder--systema_globalis/blob/master/README.md).

The experience of solving the problems in this project will prepare you for exams (and life). If someone asks you for the answer, resist! Instead, you can demonstrate how you would solve a similar problem.\n\n**Support.** You are not alone! Come to office hours and talk to your classmates. If you want to ask about the details of your solution to a problem, come see me. If you're ever feeling overwhelmed or don't know how to make progress, email for help.\n\n**Tests.** The tests that are given are **not comprehensive** and passing the tests for a question **does not** mean that you answered the question correctly. Tests usually only check that your table has the correct column labels. However, more tests will be applied to verify the correctness of your submission in order to assign your final score, so be careful and check your work! You might want to create your own checks along the way to see if your answers make sense. Additionally, before you submit, make sure that none of your cells take a very long time to run (several minutes).\n\n**Free Response Questions:** Make sure that you put the answers to the written questions in the indicated cell we provide. **Every free response question should include an explanation** that adequately answers the question.\n\n**Tabular Thinking Guide:** Feel free to reference [Tabular Thinking Guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QolEBR9azk18R7U3Ls8IZKfwrMM7IxYN/view?usp=drive_link) for extra guidance.\n\n**Advice.** Develop your answers incrementally. To perform a complicated table manipulation, break it up into steps, perform each step on a different line, give a new name to each result, and check that each intermediate result is what you expect. You can add any additional names or functions you want to the provided cells. Make sure that you are using distinct and meaningful variable names throughout the notebook. Along that line, **DO NOT** reuse the variable names that we use when we grade your answers. For example, in Question 1 of the Global Poverty section we ask you to assign an answer to `latest`. Do not reassign the variable name `latest` to anything else in your notebook, otherwise there is the chance that our tests grade against what `latest` was reassigned to.\n\nYou **never** have to use just one line in this project or any others. Use intermediate variables and multiple lines as much as you would like!\n\n---\n\nTo get started, load `datascience`, `numpy`, `plots`, and `otter`.",

We will see how factors such as life expectancy, fertility rate, and child mortality have changed over time in Bangladesh, and how they are related to the rate of population growth.\n- Next, we will examine whether the changes we have observed for Bangladesh are particular to that country or whether they reflect general patterns observable in other countries too.

The table it returns should have four columns: `geo`, `population_total`, `children_per_woman_total_fertility`, and `child_mortality_under_5_per_1000_born`. Each row should contain one unique Alpha-3 country code and three statistics: population, fertility rate, and child mortality for that `year` from the `population`, `fertility` and `child_mortality` tables. Only include rows for which all three statistics are available for the country and year.\n\nIn addition, restrict the result to country codes that appears in `big_50`, an array of the 50 most populous countries in 2020. This restriction will speed up computations later in the project.\n\nAfter you write `stats_for_year`, try calling `stats_for_year` on any year between 1960 and 2020. Try to understand the output of stats_for_year.\n\n*Hint*: The tests for this question are quite comprehensive, so if you pass the tests, your function is probably correct. However, without calling your function yourself and looking at the output, it will be very difficult to understand any problems you have, so try your best to write the function correctly and check that it works before you rely on the `grader` tests to confirm your work.\n\n*Hint*: What do all three tables have in common (pay attention to column names)?\n",

It should draw a line plot of the number of people living in poverty in that country with time on the horizontal axis. The line plot should have a point for each row in the `poverty` table for that country.
